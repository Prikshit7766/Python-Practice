#Polymorphism is reffer to use single type entity (method,operator or object) to represent different types in different scenarios

name = "Jim"   # str
print(len(name))


some_list = ["some","name"]  #list
print(len(some_list))
# That's  polymorphism in action, single function does now 
#how to handle different kinds of object as expected
